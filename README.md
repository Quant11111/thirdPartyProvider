# Sample Hardhat Project

This project is meant to lock value onchain during a transaction after choosing a 3rd party.
As for example, this platform could be used by escrow companies as a solution to help clients performing huge onchain payments.

Notice: Companies who want to provide escrow services can contact me to be whiteListed as trusted Third Party on the factory contract.
